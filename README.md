## Step 3
We say I input 1. It will then show me to inputs saying(Enter the number that you want the code to start from:) then if you input your first number which you want to begin with,it will print for you the second input.(Enter the number that you want the code to end:)
## Step 4
If I input 2 in the first input and then I input 9 at the second input,It will print for me all the even numbers in between(including the one you started with if it is even)
